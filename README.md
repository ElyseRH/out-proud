### User Stories

**Theme**

A website to assist individuals in coming out as LGBTQ+.

**Epic**

The website allows the user (creator) the ability to create a private page which can securely be sent to individuals (viewer). Only specified viewers can see the page, and the creator controls the content of the page. Content may include: personal photos/videos/text and educational/explanatory resources for viewers who may need them.

**User stories**

* As a creator, I can securely sign into the website so that my information is kept private.

* As a creator, I can create a private page with a personal photo, video or text so that I can personalise my coming-out.

* As a creator, I can add resources to my page so that I can educate the viewer if needed.

* As a creator, I can edit my page so that I can make changes if they are needed.

* As a creator, I can securely share a page with specified viewers so that I can come out to them without being in the same physical space.

* As a creator, I can privately share a page so that I can come out without my private information being freely available on the web to anyone other than the specified viewer.

* As a viewer/creator, I can sign in intuitively so that I can use the website easily.

* As a viewer/creator, I can navigate the website easily and intuitively.

* As a viewer, I can view a creator’s page so that I can learn about the creator.

* As a viewer, I can follow resource links so that I can learn more about the creator’s sexuality/gender identity and find out how to be supportive.

* As a site owner, I can provide access to educational/explanatory resources that could be useful to creators and viewers so that the user does not have to do their own research if they don’t want to.

* As a site owner, I can provide a secure and private platform so that creators can come out on their own terms.

### Deployment

### Publishing

The project was deployed using Heroku. The process is as follows:

Once you have signed up to Heroku, on the top right of the dashboard there is a button labelled 'New'. This will open a dropdown; please select 'Create new app'. On the next page you can choose your region and a name for the project. Then click 'Create app'.

On the next page there is a menu along the top. Navigate to 'Settings', where you will find the config vars. Scroll down to the section named 'Config vars' and click on the button labelled 'Reveal config vars'.

CONFIG VAR INFO HERE AND CORRESPONDING GITPOD CHANGES NEEDED

If you scroll back to the top of the page you will find the 'Deploy' tab, which has multiple options for deployment. I used Github for this project. When you click on the Github button a bar will come up for you to search for the repo you wish to connect to.

Once you have connected, you have the option to deploy automatically (the app will update every time you push) or manually (update only when you choose). I chose automatic but you can do what suits you.

After the first push/update, your app will be ready to go!

### Forking and Cloning
 
To save a copy of the code and work on it yourself, here are the steps for forking and cloning using Github:

In the repository, click the 'Fork' button, which is on the top right-hand side, next to 'Star'.

Github will automatically create a new repo, which is forked from the original. If you would like to clone it you have two options:

Within the repository, click the 'Code' dropdown, which is located next to 'Add File' on the right (underneath the Settings tab); there is an option to download all files and save a copy locally.

In the same 'Code' dropdown, you can opt to open the code with GitHub Desktop and work from there.
